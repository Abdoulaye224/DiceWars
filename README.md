Dice Wars v0.1
----------

Dice Wars is a simple game that will allow two players to battle it out amongst the fierce action of dice rolling.

The main point, so far, is to roll a six-sided die and add your total score to 18.
There is a bonus roll feature that when rolled will gain you a 'x2' multiplier to that one roll.

If I get bored again, I will add a 'doubles' feature where once you get the same number that you rolled last time you get a 'x2' score from that and then if you get the same again you get a larger number (maybe like with strikes in bowling, so scoring will not tell you the total till you have finished the streak).
I will of course also increase the size of the total score to reach.
